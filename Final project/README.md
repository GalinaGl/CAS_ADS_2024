**The impact of molecular profiling of gliomas on treatment and prognosis**

## **Abstract**
Gliomas are a diverse group of primary brain tumors originating from glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells) in the central nervous system. Starting from 2016 WHO classification of CNS tumors and its revisions shifted the focus from purely histopathological analysis to an integrated diagnosis incorporating molecular markers. By integrating molecular markers into the diagnostic framework, clinicians can better stratify patients, tailor treatment plans, and predict clinical outcomes. This shift towards personalized medicine, based on well-established molecular data, is improving the management and treatment of gliomas, particularly in identifying patients who may benefit from specific therapies or have better prognoses.
In my project I will use genomic data from more than 900 glioma patients from the study published in Clinical Cancer Research journal in 2019 and apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between genomic alterations and diagnostics, as well as disease progression.
